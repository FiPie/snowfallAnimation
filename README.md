# snowfallAnimation
A canvas based interactive animation of falling snow... rather Christmasy. All snowflakes melt on contact with the bottom of the viewport. Press **spacebar** to activate/stop continuous snowfall, use **scrollwheel** to increase or decrease the snowfall rate and just to make it super fun **leftClick** to toggle the snow blower^^

Note: Keep the project file structure
